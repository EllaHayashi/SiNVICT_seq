The seq file is meant to be run with mixture_5-95.readcount as argument. It produces an outputfile.txt. As a comparison, we have calls_level1.sinvict to compare with our output. Our output is not correct as we were unable to determine a proper p-value (we may have been able to determine the correct p-value, but we were unable to utilize it to accurately determine mutations). Therefor we chose to still run other functions on the samples, such as mean and standard deviation, and the file includes the mutation as the T variant, as though we have determined this to be our mutation.
